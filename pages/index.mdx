I'm currently interested in Software Engineering Internships this upcoming summer! Feel free to take a look around
here to get to know me better and check out some of my work.

Please feel free to use the socials below to connect with me! I'm always available to chat.

Things I would love to talk about:
- Fullstack Development (of course!)
- AI & Machine Learning
- US History (I loved my high school class on it)
- The upcoming endings of _Stranger Things_ and _Attack on Titan_
- Various lifting splits
- Classic books
- Music!! I collect vinyls for my record player
- College football (Go Blue!)
- How the ending of _Avatar: The Last Airbender_ is perfect
