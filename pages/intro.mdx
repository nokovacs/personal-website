## Background

I grew up in **Troy, Michigan** alongside my younger brother and sister. Throughout my childhood I enjoyed to
read as many books as I could get my hands on (and would quit my sports teams to get more time do so) and heading over 
to a local lake with my family to enjoy the water. I discovered through my childhood that I had a love of problem solving. From riddles 
online to critical thinking exercises that my parents found, I enjoyed creating solutions at a young age. When I found myself preparing for my first 
year at **University of Michigan**, I still wasn't quite sure what I wanted to do.

## College

I entered college still confused about what to pursue, and the next sentence fully displays this. I entered
through the College of Engineering, intending to be pre-med, and joined _two_ business clubs my first semester
at Michigan. It's as confusing as it sounds. However, a good experience with my mandatory introductory level
coding class and talks with upperclassmen about their interests and lives led me to Computer Science. I had found
a field that allowed me to continue being the same kid who really loved solving riddles and problems.

Since then, I've been able to combine an interest in both technology and business on campus, learning more about
programming and design through my classes, and working as a **Project Manager** for BOND Consulting Group
 and **Vice President External** of Alpha Kappa Psi Professional Business Fraternity on campus. This has helped me 
to think about problems on both a technical and fundamental level, something that I really enjoy doing.

## Summer 2023

That brings us up to (almost) present day! This past summer I worked as a **Software Engineering Intern** at **Tegus**,
a fin-tech startup in Chicago. This was a big deal for me for two reasons:
1. I had never lived outside of Michigan before
2. This was my first experience working as a software engineer!

I absolutely loved Tegus and think that they did a great job of provided me with everything I needed to learn a ton.
I worked alongside the company's software engineers, picking up Jira tickets from our Kanban Board and creating
fullstack solutions to problem areas or new features for the platform! I picked up a lot of Vue on the job,
as well as Ruby On Rails, NoSQL, and even some Figma. I left the internship feeling vastly improved in my abilities
and with a huge takeaway that **I really loved coding!**
