- Implemented and trained a deep neural network in Python to classify dog images by breed
- Regularized different weight decays with my Adam optimizer
- Added two more fully connected layers for my model architecture
- Utilized transfer learning to improve results, freezing 3 layers from my source model
- Used Grayscale for data augmentation
- My end result Test AUROC was 0.8216
